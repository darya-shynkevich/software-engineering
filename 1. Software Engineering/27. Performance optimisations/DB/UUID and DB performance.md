If index is not fitted in a page => page split (that is a long operation)

It is better to use [ULID](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ulid/vignettes/intro-to-ulid.html) because UUID are random and downgrade performance due to random access to index / disk. There are huge problems during INSERT operations (index page splitting / constant B+tree rebalancing)
