Slow internet connections are still a reality for many people, especially in certain regions and developing countries. Building for slow internet connections not only benefits users with poor connectivity but also improves the overall performance and user experience of the web application.

1. **Optimize assets**: Minimize file sizes for images, CSS, JavaScript, etc. Use techniques like image compression, code minification, and lazy loading.
2. **Implement progressive web app (PWA) principles**: Use service workers to cache assets and enable offline functionality. Deliver a fast initial load with a static site generator.
3. **Prioritize critical rendering path**: Identify and optimize the critical rendering path to ensure the most important content loads quickly.
4. **Leverage browser caching**: Use appropriate caching headers to maximize browser caching of static assets.
5. **Avoid heavy client-side frameworks**: Opt for simpler, lightweight frameworks or vanilla JavaScript for better performance on slow connections.
6. **Measure and monitor performance**: Use tools like Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights, and WebPageTest to measure and track your site's performance.
