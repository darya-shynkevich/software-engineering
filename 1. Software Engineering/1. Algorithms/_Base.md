1. [The Algorithm Design Manual](http://libgen.rs/book/index.php?md5=FB25C0A3E04F12F61B5DB0EB0426DBBF) (book)
    As a review and problem recognition. The algorithm catalog portion is well beyond the scope of difficulty you'll get in an interview.

2. [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-fourth-Thomas-Cormen/dp/026204630X) (book) Reading this book will only have limited value. This book is a great review of algorithms and data structures, but won't teach you how to write good code. You have to be able to code a decent solution efficiently.
